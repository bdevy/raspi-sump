[gpio_pins]

# Raspi-Sump uses the actual GPIO numbers and not the Pi numerical pin 
# numbers.  You can use any available GPIO's for Trig and Echo.

# Trig pin sends the signal.  Value is the number of the GPIO 
# on the RaspberryPi
trig_pin = 17

# Echo pin receives the signal.  Value is the number of the GPIO 
# on the RaspberryPi

# DS18B20 Temperature Probe Pin. Value is the number of the GPIO
# on the RaspberryPi. Only valid when monitor_temperature = 1

# Monitor Temperature. When set to 1, Raspi-Sump will read the temperature
# of the sump pit using a DS18B20 temperature probe; default is 0 (no)

### CSV Storage Engine ###

# CSV - This method intends to use the original default storage system of CSV files.

### Zabbix Storage Engine ###
 
# Zabbix - This method allows sending sump/temp metrics to an existing Zabbix instance using
# the Zabbix Trapper mechanism.

# Zabbix Host. This is the hostname or IP address of the Zabbix instance you will be 
# sending data to.

### InfluxDB Storage Engine ###

# InfluxDB. This method allows sending sump/temp metrics to an existing InfluxDB instance
influxdb = 0

# InfluxDB Host. This is the hostname or IP address of the InfluxDB instance you will be
# sending data to. Required when influxdb = 1
#influxdb_host=influxdb.localhost

# InfluxDB Port. This is the Port number of the InfluxDB instance. Required when influxdb = 1
#influxdb_port=8086

# InfluxDB Username. This is the username you will authenticate to InfluxDB with. 
# Required when influxdb = 1
#influxdb_username=

# InfluxDB Password. This is the password you will authenticate to InfluxDB with.
# Required when influxdb = 1
#influxdb_password=

# InfluxDB Database. This is the name of the database you will be sending measurements to.

# Monitor Temperature. When set to 1, Raspi-Sump will read the temperature
# of the sump pit using a DS18B20 temperature probe; default is 0 (no)
monitor_temperature = 0

# DS18b20 Temperature Probe File.  When monitor_temperature is set to 1
# this must be set to the proper file of the temp probe to read the value.
# This file is created after the temperature probe is initialized.
# temperature_file = /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-01145ef3e51e/w1_slave

# Unit of measure.  You may choose to use metric or imperial measurements.  
# The unit variable must be set as metric or imperial and is case sensitive.
# Any other setting will cause an error.
unit = metric

# critical_water_level is the water level in the sump pit at which point an 
# email alert should be triggered. 
# If unit = metric then critical_water_level = centimeters
# If unit = imperial then critical_water_level = inches

# sump pit.
# Like critical_water_level, enter centimeters for metric and inches for
# imperial

# rsump.py should be run with a cron job.  However cron is limited to
# 1 minute as its minimum interval. If you need to monitor the sump level
# more frequently you can set reading_interval to the desired time in seconds.
# Default is 0 meaning only one reading will occur and the program will exit.
# If set to 0 call the script with a cron job and select your interval there.
# If setting to a value other than 0 you should run rsumpmonitor.py from a cron
# job at a regularly interval to monitor the health of the rsump.py process.
# rsumpmonitor.py is part of the raspisump software.  See documentation for
# details.
reading_interval = 0

# The temperature variable will adjust the speed of sound to reflect 
# the normal temperature of your basement.  
# If unit = metric then enter the temperature in Degrees Celcius.
# If unit = imperial then enter the temperature in Degrees Fahrenheit.
temperature = 20

# Raspi-Sump can also be used in situations where you would want to check if
# the water_level is too low. Sump pits are concerned with high water levels
# but a drinking water cistern would require an alert when it is low.  For that
# reason you can set the following value to 'low'.  Leave this value as is unless
# you specifically want alerts when the water drops below a certain level.
alert_when = high

[charts]
# This section deals with charting

# ***Important information for Gmail users only.***
# ***Please read this thread on allowing applications to send
# ***email from Googles Gmail service which have implemented ouath2.
# ***https://github.com/alaudet/raspi-sump/issues/6

# ***Raspi-sump does not implement oauth2 for authentication so you will need 
# ***to use a workaround for gmail to send alerts.

# Set an appropriate interval for alerts.  If you are taking readings at short
# intervals it is possible to bombard yourself with SMS text messages when the
# water reaches a critical level.  For example if you are taking a reading
# every minute or less an SMS Email alert will be sent each time the reading is
# taken.  By setting the alert_interval this allows you to receive an email
# alert at a more appropriate time interval.  Readings will continue and will
# be logged but SMS text alerts will only be sent as you define it.  
# alert_interval is set in minutes. The default is 5 minutes if this value is not present.
